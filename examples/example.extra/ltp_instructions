# LTP instructions
In mkosi.extra:
``` git clone https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.git```
Then in qemu:
```
cd /ltp
make autotools
./configure
#now to build and install the tests
make
make install
```

Now you can navigate to /opt/ltp to run the tests.

# For smaller projects
If we don't want to do a FULL test suite every time, we can simply
change into the test directory and then build and execute the tests from
there.

```
cd testcases/kernel/mem/hugetlb
make
make install
```

Now you can find the testcases in /opt/ltp/testcases/bin to run the tests.
See the included script for running our desired tests (because its a pain
to install all the ltp tests to get runltp happy).
