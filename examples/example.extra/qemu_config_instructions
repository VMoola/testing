To make a basic configuration file for a kernel, run "make defconfig"
This is the smallest bootable kernel by qemu.

Then go into the config and enable anything we might want based on testing.
Common dependencies are:

LOCKDEP (if anything lock related)
DEBUG_VM - Everything in general
DWARF_TOOLCHAIN and BTF - pahole for modifying structures
MODULES_FORCE_UNLOAD - for unloading test modules even if kernel is unsafe

"make debug.config" is good for thorough intensive testing, just sometimes
bigger/more excessive than necessary.

*pahole doesn't work in qemu, but it does work in a systemd container*
