# Using custom modules for kernel functionality

If we ever want to build modules, ON TOP of the basic debugging kernel
requirements, we will then also need the following:
```
Module.Symvers      - Generated by MODPOST in 'make modules'
scripts/            - present by default
tools/              - present by default
Makefile            - present by default
```

Having these files will let us build external modules that can be hotplugged.

Then look at the files for examples:
```
modules_example/device.c
example_scripts/device_example.c
```

When dealing with device ioctls, we can simply find a value that is NOT being
used already. This becomes undefined behavior if we try to override one, so
make sure to check.
